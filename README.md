# Simulation Framework for Encapsulation/Decapsulation Concepts

This project implements a simulation framework to demonstrate encapsulation and decapsulation processes in a client-server architecture. The framework uses JavaScript for the server and provides a web-based interface for visualization.

## Features
- Encapsulation of data into packets with transport-layer headers.
- Decapsulation for packet validation and data reconstruction.
- Error detection using checksum validation.
- Detailed logging for analysis of data integrity and transmission reliability.
- Interactive front-end for user interaction.

## Project Structure
- server.js: Main server-side application.
- package.json: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- public/index.html: Front-end of the application for user interaction.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system.

### Steps

1. *Clone the Repository*
   Extract the zip file to a directory of your choice.

2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*
   bash
   cd Simulation_Animation_Framework_for_Ethernet_Concepts

3. Install Dependencies  
    bash
    npm install

4. Start the Server
   bash
   node server.js

5. Access the Application
    arduino
   http://localhost:3000

### How It Works
- The server handles encapsulation and decapsulation processes.
- The front-end visualizes data transmission and displays logs for analysis.
- Checksum validation ensures data integrity during the simulation.
